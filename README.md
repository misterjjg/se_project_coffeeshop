# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

To improve this project I would change the recipes section because it looks too bland. By adding a more visually appealing background or some sort of animation to the videos would make the section pop more.
